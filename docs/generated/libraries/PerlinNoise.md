## PerlinNoise


An implementation of Perlin Noise that uses 16 bit fixed point arithmetic.





### noise2d

```solidity
function noise2d(int256 x, int256 y) internal pure returns (int256)
```

Computes the noise value for a 2D point.

_This function should be kept public. Inlining the bytecode for this function
     into other functions could explode its compiled size because of how `ftable`
     and `ptable` were written._

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| x | int256 | the x coordinate. |
| y | int256 | the y coordinate. |



### noise3d

```solidity
function noise3d(int256 x, int256 y, int256 z) internal pure returns (int256)
```

Computes the noise value for a 3D point.

_This function should be kept public. Inlining the bytecode for this function
     into other functions could explode its compiled size because of how `ftable`
     and `ptable` were written._

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| x | int256 | the x coordinate. |
| y | int256 | the y coordinate. |
| z | int256 | the z coordinate. |



### lerp

```solidity
function lerp(int256 t, int256 a, int256 b) internal pure returns (int256)
```

Computes the linear interpolation between two values, `a` and `b`, using fixed point arithmetic.


| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| t | int256 | the time value of the equation. |
| a | int256 | the lower point. |
| b | int256 | the upper point. |



### fade

```solidity
function fade(int256 t) internal pure returns (int256)
```

Applies the fade function to a value.

_The polynomial for this function is: 6t^4-15t^4+10t^3._

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| t | int256 | the time value of the equation. |



### grad2

```solidity
function grad2(int256 h, int256 x, int256 y) internal pure returns (int256)
```

Computes the gradient value for a 2D point.


| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| h | int256 | the hash value to use for picking the vector. |
| x | int256 | the x coordinate of the point. |
| y | int256 | the y coordinate of the point. |



### grad3

```solidity
function grad3(int256 h, int256 x, int256 y, int256 z) internal pure returns (int256)
```

Computes the gradient value for a 3D point.


| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| h | int256 | the hash value to use for picking the vector. |
| x | int256 | the x coordinate of the point. |
| y | int256 | the y coordinate of the point. |
| z | int256 | the z coordinate of the point. |



### ptable

```solidity
function ptable(int256 i) internal pure returns (int256)
```

Gets a subsequent values in the permutation table at an index. The values are encoded
        into a single 24 bit integer with the  value at the specified index being the most
        significant 12 bits and the subsequent value being the least significant 12 bits.

_The values from the table are mapped out into a binary tree for faster lookups.
     Looking up any value in the table in this implementation is is O(8), in
     the implementation of sequential if statements it is O(255).

The body of this function is autogenerated. Check out the 'gen-ptable' script._

| Name | Type | Description |

| i | int256 | the index in the permutation table. |



### ftable

```solidity
function ftable(int256 i) internal pure returns (int256)
```

Gets subsequent values in the fade table at an index. The values are encoded
        into a single 16 bit integer with the value at the specified index being the most
        significant 8 bits and the subsequent value being the least significant 8 bits.

_The values from the table are mapped out into a binary tree for faster lookups.
     Looking up any value in the table in this implementation is is O(8), in
     the implementation of sequential if statements it is O(256).

The body of this function is autogenerated. Check out the 'gen-ftable' script._

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| i | int256 | the index in the fade table. |
